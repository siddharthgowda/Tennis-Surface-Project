# README
It's well known that different tennis court surfaces have unique properties, and those properties affect certain aspects of the game differently. Thus, for this project we analyzed singles ATP match data from 2019, and performed analysis, comparing data from each surface type.

## Raw Data files:
- `atp_data_2019.csv`
- `atp_matches_2019.csv`

All other data files are created after cleaning.

## The Paper:
The final paper is written in a pdf format with the file name `tennis_surface_report.pdf` and the raw file is in `tennis_surface_report.Rmd`
